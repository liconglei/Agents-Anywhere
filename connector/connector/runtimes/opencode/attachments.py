"""Materialize platform attachments into local files opencode can read.

opencode accepts ``{"type": "file", "mime", "filename", "url"}`` parts on
``prompt_async``; the ``url`` may point at a local file (``file://`` URL),
which serve reads at prompt time and inlines into the model context. The
platform stores attachments server-side, so each part is first downloaded
through the runtime host and staged under the connector data directory.

The staged layout is ``<session>/<file_id>/<name>``: opencode echoes the
``url`` back verbatim in stored message parts, so the timeline mapper can
recover the platform ``fileId`` from the staged path's parent directory and
the client can render the attachment chip with its normal authenticated URL.
