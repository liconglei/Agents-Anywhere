"""OpenCode runtime adapter.

Self-contained: talks directly to a local ``opencode serve`` instance over
REST + SSE. No plugin bridge required (unlike DSH).

Session model:
- The opencode native id (``ses_...``) is used as both the platform
  ``session_id`` and ``external_session_id`` (single-instance runtime).
- Turns are driven by ``POST /session/{id}/prompt_async``; the global SSE
  stream reports progress and ``session.idle`` marks turn completion.
- Timeline: ``message.part.delta`` / ``message.part.updated`` are streamed into
  the platform timeline live (throttled, one stable item id per opencode part);
  ``GET /session/{id}/message`` rebuilds the authoritative snapshot at turn end.

#
# opencode has no separate "mode" field — the mode *is* the primary agent that
# runs the turn, so a selection is applied by sending ``agent: <preset>`` on the
# prompt (``POST /session/{id}/prompt_async``). opencode persists the agent on
# the session record, which is also how the current mode is read back.
#
# Do NOT try to switch modes by PATCHing ``{"permission": [...]}`` onto the
# session (that looks like the obvious API): on serve 1.18.34 the array is
# *appended* to the session's existing rules instead of replacing it, so
# switching Plan → Build leaves Plan's ``edit * deny`` behind (read-only Build)
# and grows the ruleset on every switch. The mode therefore applies from the
